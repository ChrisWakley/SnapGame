A basic Snap game, build solely in Java.

I found several hurdles during this project, overcoming each hurdle as it came up was rather fun and satisfying.

I've come to a point where I'm happy with how this game has turned out; it plays smoothly and all the methods work in the correct way and order.

several challenging points for me were: implementing alternating player turns, creating a way for the snap timed player input to work with the code
as i had written it.

This version of the game will run with 2 players and will continuously offer the players the choice between a new game or exiting the game on
each of the available game conclusions.

This project effectively contains a launcher upon which i could add other card games to the library and allow for player selection on which game
they wish to play on start up, while this would mean A: adding new full games to the repo and B: modifying the intro method to direct to different
games when selected (currently it will default to snap or exit the program run). The framework for this functionality is there though and each
game would be able to load the same method to access the card deck.

If i were to improve this particular game, I'd look at adding further players, implementing a difficulty system for the response time to allow the 
players to set the time they'd have to respond to the occurence of a Snap. I would also look at changing text colours.
